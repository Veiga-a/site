## Hello, my name is João Victor!

I'm a data science student currently in my 5th semester at FAE Centro Universitário. My journey in technology began with ever since I was a kid, and since then I've been improving my skills in various technologies and methodologies.

Currently, I work as a treasury intern at Faurecia, where I develop analytical and financial management skills that complement my technical education.

### My Vision

I constantly seek to improve my technical and soft skills to become a well-rounded professional. I have a strong interest in working abroad, especially in Europe or Canada, where I can expand my professional and cultural horizons.

### Outside of Work

During my free time, I love staying active at the gym, unwinding with games or shows, and expressing myself through the piano. I have a deep fascination with the universe—black holes, in particular, truly captivate me
